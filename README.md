**Project Title**: Predicting Aqueous Solubility of Molecules using Different Machine Learning Methods

This work is based on the research article of John S. Delaney entitled **ESOL:â€‰ Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure**  which focuses on the application Linear Regression to predict the solubility of molecules which is an important physiochemical property to consider in drug design and development.
 
The source code is inspired from this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXFFHHoE1wk&list=PLtqF5YXg7GLlQJUv9XJ3RWdd5VYGwBHrP&index=10).

The following modifications are made in this work :
+ The relationship between X variable and Y is visualized through scatter plots and correlation analysis.<br>
+ Both X and Y are normalized. <br>
+ Apart from multiple linear regression shown in the video, this work also implements other regression techniques including random forest regression, lasso regression, XGBoost regression and support vector regression.<br>
+ The MSE and R2 coefficient of the regression models are compared.
